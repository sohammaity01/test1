    <h1>Dangling life!</h1>
    <p>Only if I knew how life's gonna come at me, I never would've opted for it. Ironically none of us facing such difficulties were never given the choice!</p>
    <p>Life is all about perspectives. But it is true that its hard for everyone. Everyone one has setbacks in life. Not comparable. Each one to his/her own. </p>
